# throwing a py Exception, it results in an uncaught C++ error that crashes the
# iPython kernel. And its signature or internals may unexpectedly change at any
# point in the future, since it's not a stable part of the API.
#
# Anyway, the crux of the matter is: it forces us to commit to a single batch
# size for the entire network architecture.

# ## Generative Adversarial Networks
# See Goodfellow et al (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661v1.pdf) for a description of GANs.
# 
# In essence, we pit two network against each other in a game. A discriminative network attempts to determine whether an input image belongs to the training distribution, or is a forgery. A generative network attempts to produce forgeries which fool the discriminative network.
# 
# See Radford, Metz, & Chintala (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v1.pdf) for useful constraints on GAN architecture. The authors make the following recommendations:
# 
# - Use strided convolutions rather than max pooling.
# - Use batchnorm everywhere other than generator output and discriminator input.
# - No dense hidden layers.
# - ReLU units in the generator (except output, which uses Tanh) and Leaky ReLU (with a leak of 0.2) in the discriminator.
# 
# I'll be using exponential liniar units (ELU) instead of ReLU / Leaky ReLU, and see if I can get away without batchnorm, as the ELU addresses some of the same issues: namely, encouraging inputs to each unit to approach 0, and allowing gradients to penetrate further into deep networks. Otherwise, I'll attempt to cleave to their suggestions.
# 
# The general architecture that Radford et al recommend for the generator is based on DCGAN. A vector of uniformly distributed noise is projected onto a small 2d image with a large number of channels. Repeated "fractionally strided convolutions" (sometimes erroneously called "deconvolutions", really the transpose of the convolution) successfively scale down the number of channels and scale up the size of the image.
# 
# They further recommend the following hyperparameters:
# - Weights initialized with a 0-centered normal distribution having a std of 0.02
# - Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002 and beta-1 of 0.5

# #### Discriminative Network
# 
# The discriminative network maps a 28 x 28 1-channel image to single float between 0 and 1, representing the probability that the image came from the training data distribution rather than the generative network.
# 
# The input of the discriminator is hooked up to the output of the generator. This lets us either train the discriminator, by ignoring the generator portion of the computation graph and providing input images in the feed dict, or the generator, by freezing the variables in the discriminator and feeding in noise.
